Project goal: Build a modern, ultra-polished, fully responsive personal portfolio website for Mididoddi Sindhu using only HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. The design should be premium, recruiter-friendly, and visually striking — with lush backgrounds, smooth micro-interactions, subtle motion, and a clear hierarchy that highlights Sindhu’s AI/ML, web and research work. Use the uploaded resume at /mnt/data/Sindhu_Resume (1).pdf as the canonical content source and downloadable CV. 

Sindhu_Resume (1)

High-level style & mood: premium minimalism — soft layered gradients, glassmorphism cards, gentle shadows, rounded corners, and refined typography. The hero should use a dramatic full-bleed background (animated gradient + soft blurred shapes or parallax particles) that remains tasteful and performance-friendly. Prioritize fast load, accessibility, and mobile-first responsive behavior.

Structure & Exact Content

Build these sections with the exact resume content (internships, projects, skills, certifications, achievements, education, contact details, patent).

9) Contact

Email: mididoddisindhu59@gmail.com

Phone: +91 6305167238

Social: GitHub, LinkedIn (icons + external links)

Contact form: name / email / message, front-end validation, simple honeypot anti-spam field.

UI / Interaction Requirements (must follow)

Hero background: animated gradient + blurred shape layers or lightweight SVG particle/parallax. Maintain high FPS and use will-change sparingly.

Cards & surfaces: glassmorphism panels with subtle inner/outer shadows and hover lift (transform: translateY(-6px) + box-shadow).

Animations: use CSS transitions & IntersectionObserver for scroll reveal. Keep JS minimal — use CSS for motion where possible.

Hover micro-interactions: project cards reveal description + buttons on hover; buttons have subtle move/scale and ripple or underline effects.

Skills: animated bars or circular progress that animate on scroll into view. Provide accessible text fallback.

Navbar: sticky with glass blur; animated underline on active link; collapsible hamburger for mobile with smooth open/close animation.

Dark/Light toggle: store preference in localStorage. Provide contrasting accessible palettes.

Performance: lazy-load images (loading="lazy"), use SVG icons, compress images, avoid large JS bundles.

Accessibility: semantic HTML, keyboard focusable elements, ARIA labels where needed, visible focus states, and WCAG color contrast.

Technical & Delivery Requirements

Tech stack: static site — plain HTML files, css/ (global or modular CSS), js/main.js for interactivity, assets/ for images/icons. No frameworks.

Folder structure: index.html, css/styles.css, js/main.js, assets/images/*, assets/icons/*, resume.pdf (use /mnt/data/Sindhu_Resume (1).pdf). 

Sindhu_Resume (1)

Progressive enhancement: content should be readable and navigable without JS; JS progressively enhances UX (animations, lazy-loading, form validation).

Documentation: include README.md with “open index.html” instructions and an optional npm script suggestion for image optimization (e.g., imagemin).

Code quality: modular CSS (BEM or utility classes), well-commented JS, and inline comments indicating where to update GitHub/LinkedIn URLs.

Deliverables: complete source code, optimized images & favicons, README, and a short style guide (colors, fonts, spacing, icon set).

Final polish & acceptance criteria

Hero, projects, and contact sections must feel exceptionally clear and usable on first view.

Animations must be smooth (no jank), mobile interactions snappy, and page weight optimized.

Provide an exportable ZIP of the static site and a short “how to update” guide in README.

Note: Use the resume file at /mnt/data/Sindhu_Resume (1).pdf as the canonical text and downloadable CV.
